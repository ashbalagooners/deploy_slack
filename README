K. Recipe C.

The dumbest possible recipe organizer for Katherine.

INSTALL

This package depends on the RDiscount, Sinatra, and Unicorn gems plus, of course, a Ruby interpreter.

Once the dependencies are met, run

    rackup

in the root directory (which contains config.ru) to start the application.

TODO

* Need to decide on a way to differentiate inferred tags and explicit tags.
* Need to exclude stop words and abbreviations.
